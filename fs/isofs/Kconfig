config FS_ISOFS
	bool "ISO 9660 CDROM file system support"
	help
	  This is the standard file system used on CD-ROMs.  It was previously
	  known as "High Sierra File System" and is called "hsfs" on other
	  Unix systems.  The so-called Rock-Ridge extensions which allow for
	  long Unix filenames and symbolic links are also supported by this
	  driver.  If you have a CD-ROM drive and want to do more with it than
	  just listen to audio CDs and watch its LEDs, say Y , otherwise say N.
	  You can also enable CMD_ISOFS to get access to isofs commands.
